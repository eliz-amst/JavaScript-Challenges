# FizzBuzz Challenge

**Instructions:**

- Print/log the numbers from 1 to 100
- For **multiples of three** print "Fizz" instead of the number
- For **multiples of five** print "Buzz"
- For numbers which are **multiples of both three and five** print "FizzBuzz".

**Hints:**

If you have taken the course up to this point, then you know how to write a loop and output/log something for each iteration. You also know how to check for a condition with "if/else/else if". You also know how to get a remainder of a number using the modulus operator (%). This is all you need to know to complete this challenge. Good luck!
